I’ve been meaning to start writing again, but I kept stalling on the question of "where?" I’ve never liked handing my thoughts to someone else’s platform, and that feels even worse now given the chase for likes and the pile of AI generated slop.

I wanted to learn more about Netlify and similar services, and I needed a use case, so I set up a static site that commits to GitHub and gets automatically pushed into production at Netlify. There are simpler ways to get HTML online - I still remember hand coding HTML in 1993 using [the original HTML spec](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-iiir-html-00) and FTPing files to the company web server. 

This site runs on a simple build and deployment flow. A local script turns Markdown into HTML, commits it to a Git repo, and Netlify deploys it. If I wasn’t interested in leaving room for app driven dynamic content later, I’d probably just use GitHub Pages, Surge.sh, or a host like NearlyFreeSpeech.

So, Hello World! rossrader.ca is back on the air.
