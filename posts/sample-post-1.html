        <div class="post-content">
          <p>
            We're witnessing a fundamental shift in how internet services work. For thirty
            years, the web has been built on a model of information retrieval—users search,
            click, navigate, and consume. But AI is changing the game, transforming internet
            services from passive repositories into active participants in our digital lives.
          </p>

          <p>
            Having spent decades in the internet services industry, I've seen many
            technological waves. But this one feels different. AI isn't just improving
            existing paradigms—it's creating entirely new ones.
          </p>

          <h2>From Retrieval to Interaction</h2>

          <p>
            Traditional internet services are essentially sophisticated filing systems.
            Search engines index content. Websites organize information. APIs serve data.
            The user does all the cognitive work—finding, filtering, synthesizing.
          </p>

          <p>
            AI-powered services flip this model. Instead of retrieving information for
            users to process, they process information for users. The service understands
            context, generates insights, and takes action. The relationship becomes
            conversational rather than transactional.
          </p>

          <p>
            This shift has profound implications:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Users can express intent in natural language rather than learning query syntax</li>
            <li>Services can anticipate needs based on context and history</li>
            <li>Complex multi-step tasks become simple conversations</li>
            <li>The barrier to entry for sophisticated capabilities drops dramatically</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>The Personalization Paradox</h2>

          <p>
            We've talked about personalization in internet services for years, but
            we've mostly failed to deliver it at scale. Why? Because true personalization
            requires understanding nuance, context, and individual preferences in ways
            that traditional systems simply can't.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            "The best interface is no interface." — Golden Krishna
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            AI makes genuine personalization possible. A service can learn your
            communication style, understand your priorities, and adapt its behavior
            accordingly. But here's the paradox: as services become more personalized,
            they also become less transparent. We need to design for both capability
            and comprehensibility.
          </p>

          <h2>Infrastructure Implications</h2>

          <p>
            The infrastructure requirements for AI-powered internet services are
            fundamentally different from traditional web services. We're moving from:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Stateless to stateful:</strong> AI services need persistent context and memory</li>
            <li><strong>Deterministic to probabilistic:</strong> Outputs are generated, not retrieved</li>
            <li><strong>Instant to conversational:</strong> Interactions unfold over time</li>
            <li><strong>Static to dynamic:</strong> Services evolve through use rather than updates</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            This requires rethinking core assumptions about caching, scaling,
            reliability, and cost management. A service that generates unique
            responses can't rely on traditional CDN strategies. A system that
            maintains conversational state needs new approaches to session management.
          </p>

          <h2>The Customer Experience Challenge</h2>

          <p>
            From a customer experience perspective, AI-powered services present both
            opportunities and challenges. The opportunity: dramatically reduce friction
            and cognitive load. The challenge: maintain trust and control.
          </p>

          <p>
            Users need to understand what the service is doing and why. They need
            the ability to correct course when the AI misunderstands. They need
            confidence that their data is being used appropriately. These aren't
            technical problems—they're design problems.
          </p>

          <p>
            The best AI-powered services will be those that make intelligence feel
            natural while keeping humans firmly in control. Not "AI replacing humans"
            but "AI augmenting human capability."
          </p>

          <h2>What This Means for Builders</h2>

          <p>
            If you're building internet services today, you need to be thinking about
            how AI changes your value proposition. The question isn't whether to
            integrate AI—it's how to do it in ways that genuinely serve users.
          </p>

          <p>
            Start by asking: What cognitive work are we currently forcing users to do?
            Where are the friction points in our service? What would it mean to make
            our interface conversational rather than navigational?
          </p>

          <p>
            The services that win won't be those with the most advanced AI. They'll
            be those that use AI to eliminate complexity while maintaining clarity.
            That's the real challenge—and opportunity—ahead.
