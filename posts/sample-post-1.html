            We live in an era of incredible complexity. Modern software stacks involve
            dozens of dependencies, intricate build systems, and layers upon layers of
            abstraction. While this complexity sometimes serves a purpose, we've
            normalized it to the point where simple solutions feel almost suspicious.
          </p>

          <p>
            I've been thinking about this a lot lately as I've returned to building
            with plain HTML and CSS. There's something refreshing about opening a text
            editor, writing some markup, and seeing immediate results in a browser.
            No build step. No framework. No configuration files.
          </p>

          <h2>The Allure of Complexity</h2>

          <p>
            Why do we reach for complex tools so quickly? Part of it is social—we want
            to use what others are using, to stay relevant and employable. Part of it
            is the promise of productivity—these tools claim to make us faster, more
            efficient, more capable.
          </p>

          <p>
            And sometimes they do. Modern frameworks can be powerful accelerators for
            certain types of projects. But we've lost sight of the cost:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Time spent learning and configuring tools instead of building</li>
            <li>Cognitive overhead of understanding multiple layers of abstraction</li>
            <li>Fragility introduced by dependencies and breaking changes</li>
            <li>The slow erosion of fundamental skills</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Simple Doesn't Mean Simplistic</h2>

          <p>
            There's an important distinction here. Simple tools aren't necessarily
            simplistic or limited. A plain text file can hold profound ideas. HTML
            and CSS, while basic, are remarkably powerful and expressive.
          </p>

          <p>
            Simple tools have properties that complex ones often lack:
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            "Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when
            there is nothing left to take away." — Antoine de Saint-Exupéry
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            They're easier to understand, easier to maintain, and more resilient to
            change. A static HTML file from 1995 still works perfectly in a modern
            browser. Can we say the same about a React app from 2015?
          </p>

          <h2>Choosing the Right Tool</h2>

          <p>
            This isn't an argument against complexity when it's warranted. Large,
            interactive applications benefit from frameworks and tooling. The key
            is intentionality—reaching for the simplest tool that adequately solves
            the problem.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ask yourself: What is this tool buying me? What is it costing me? Is
            there a simpler alternative that would work just as well?
          </p>

          <p>
            Often, the answer surprises you. That blog doesn't need a JavaScript
            framework. That documentation site doesn't need a complex static site
            generator. That quick prototype doesn't need a build system.
          </p>

          <h2>Rediscovering Fundamentals</h2>

          <p>
            Working with simple tools reconnects you with fundamentals. When you
            write raw HTML, you understand the structure of the web. When you write
            vanilla CSS, you understand layout and styling at a deeper level.
          </p>

          <p>
            These fundamentals make you better at using complex tools too. You
            understand what's happening under the hood. You can diagnose problems
            more effectively. You can make better architectural decisions.
          </p>

          <p>
            So here's my challenge: Next time you start a project, pause before
            reaching for your usual stack. Could you build this with simpler tools?
            Would it be worth trying?
          </p>

          <p>
            You might be surprised by what you discover.
