          <p>
            There's a persistent myth about creativity: that it's a gift bestowed upon
            a lucky few. That some people are "creative types" while others simply
            aren't. That inspiration strikes like lightning, unpredictable and
            uncontrollable.
          </p>

          <p>
            I believed this for years. I'd wait for the right mood, the perfect
            moment, the flash of inspiration. Unsurprisingly, I didn't create much.
          </p>

          <h2>Creativity as Practice</h2>

          <p>
            The turning point came when I started treating creativity like any other
            skill—something you develop through consistent practice, not divine
            intervention. This meant showing up regularly, even when I didn't feel
            particularly inspired.
          </p>

          <p>
            Here's what I learned: Creativity isn't about waiting for the muse. It's
            about creating conditions where good work can happen. It's about building
            momentum through regular practice. It's about quantity leading to quality.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            "Amateurs sit and wait for inspiration, the rest of us just get up and
            go to work." — Stephen King
          </blockquote>

          <h2>The Value of Routine</h2>

          <p>
            Many creative people resist routine, fearing it will stifle their
            spontaneity. But I've found the opposite to be true. A consistent creative
            practice—same time, same place—removes the friction of starting.
          </p>

          <p>
            When creativity becomes habitual, you spend less energy deciding whether
            to work and more energy on the work itself. The blank page becomes less
            intimidating when you face it every day.
          </p>

          <h3>My Current Practice</h3>

          <p>
            I write every morning before checking email or social media. It's not
            always good writing—most days it isn't. But the practice compounds:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Bad sentences become okay sentences become good sentences</li>
            <li>Struggling with ideas builds the muscle of thinking</li>
            <li>Showing up builds confidence and reduces resistance</li>
            <li>Regular output creates a body of work to refine</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The key insight: You can't edit a blank page. You can always improve
            mediocre work, but you have to create it first.
          </p>

          <h2>Constraints as Creativity Boosters</h2>

          <p>
            Another counterintuitive lesson: constraints enhance creativity rather
            than limiting it. Total freedom is paralyzing. Give yourself boundaries
            and suddenly you have something to work with, push against, play within.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some constraints I've found helpful:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Time limits:</strong> Write for exactly 30 minutes, no more, no less</li>
            <li><strong>Format constraints:</strong> Keep posts under 1000 words</li>
            <li><strong>Topic constraints:</strong> Write only about what you learned this week</li>
            <li><strong>Tool constraints:</strong> Use only plain text, no formatting</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Constraints force decisions. They eliminate options, which paradoxically
            makes you more creative in working with what remains. Twitter's character
            limit made people more concise and inventive with language. Haiku's strict
            structure pushes poets toward precision and impact.
          </p>

          <h2>Embracing the Messy Middle</h2>

          <p>
            Every creative project goes through phases. The beginning is exciting—
            full of possibility and enthusiasm. The end is satisfying—you have
            something tangible to show. But the middle is where most people quit.
          </p>

          <p>
            The middle is messy. Your initial vision meets reality. What seemed
            clear becomes murky. You question whether the idea was good to begin
            with. This is normal. This is part of the process.
          </p>

          <p>
            The professionals push through the middle. They trust that clarity will
            emerge from confusion, that the work will cohere eventually. They've
            been here before and know it's temporary.
          </p>

          <h2>Shipping Matters</h2>

          <p>
            Creative work isn't complete until it's shared. The act of finishing
            and publishing—however imperfect—is itself a skill worth developing.
          </p>

          <p>
            I've learned more from publishing 100 flawed pieces than from perfecting
            one. Each publication teaches you something: how to connect with readers,
            what resonates, where your blind spots are. Perfectionism keeps this
            learning locked away.
          </p>

          <p>
            Seth Godin writes a blog post every single day. Not all of them are
            brilliant. But the consistency builds an audience and sharpens his
            thinking in ways that endless revision never could.
          </p>

          <h2>Building Your Practice</h2>

          <p>
            If you want to develop a creative practice, start small. Don't commit
            to writing a novel—commit to writing for 10 minutes daily. Don't plan
            an ambitious project—make something small and finish it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Pay attention to what works for you. When do you have the most energy?
            What environment helps you focus? What constraints make the work easier?
          </p>

          <p>
            Be patient with yourself. A sustainable creative practice develops over
            months and years, not days. Show up consistently, embrace the mess, and
            ship regularly.
          </p>

          <p>
            The muse might show up eventually. But you don't need her. You've got
            practice, routine, and momentum. That's more than enough.
